This repo is a reproduction of a bug in Angular 2's change detection I came across while implementing QuaggaJS in a component.

To run:

    Clone the repo
    Run npm install to install the project (This project uses the Angular CLI)
    Run node_modules\.bin\ng s -h 0.0.0.0 to start a dev server on all interfaces
    Browse to your dev server running on port 4200 using a device capable of running Quagga livestream code (I've used an Asus ZenPad 8 with Firefox Mobile)
